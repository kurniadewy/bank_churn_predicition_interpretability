# 💸 Loan Default Prediction with XGBoost and Model Interpretability

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to predict loan default risk using machine learning classification techniques. The workflow includes preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and interpretability using XGBoost.

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Data cleaning and EDA
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, XGBoost, LGBM
- Evaluation and model selection
- Model interpretation using:
  - Feature importance
  - Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)

## 🧠 Best Model: XGBoost
Chosen for its performance. Interpretability includes feature ranking and PDP plots.

## 🔍 Key Features
- `total_trans_amnt`, `total_amt_chng_q4_q1`, `total_ct_chng_q4_q1`, `total_revolving_bal`, `total_relationship_count` are key predictors of default risk.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to replicate analysis and plots.
